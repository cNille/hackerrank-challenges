## Description 
There are two kangaroos on an x-axis ready to jump in the
positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity). The first kangaroo starts
at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump. The second kangaroo
starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump. Given the starting
locations and movement rates for each kangaroo, can you determine if they'll
ever land at the same location at the same time?

## Input format 
A single line of four space-separated integers denoting the respective values of *x1*, *v1*, *x2*, and *v2*.

## Constraints 
- 0 <= x1 < x2 <= 10000 
- 1 <= v1 <= 1000 
- 1 <= v2 <= 1000


## Output format

Print YES if they can land on the same location at the same time; otherwise, print NO.

Note: The two kangaroos must land at the same location after making the same number of jumps.

## Sample input

> 0 3 4 2

## Sample output

> YES
